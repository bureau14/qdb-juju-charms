summary: An advanced distributed key-value store
maintainer: quasardb <bug@quasardb.net>
description: |
  quasardb is a distributed key-value store. It scales horizontally and vertically for virtually unlimited capabilities. 
  You can store raw data of any form and size into quasardb, but should you need to, you can also do atomic operations on integers, manipulate queues and sets. 
  quasardb is write-safe by default and offers features to sync absolutely everything you do for maximum safety. 
  Thanks to its master-less design, quasardb is able to face the loss of nodes transparently.
